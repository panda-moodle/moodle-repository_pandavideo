# Panda Video Repository Plugin

This repository is part of the Panda Video integration plugin suite for Moodle.

> ⚠️ **Requires the [`mod_pandavideo`](https://github.com/seuusuario/mod_pandavideo) and `media_pandavideo` plugins to be installed and configured.**  
> 🔑 **An API key must be configured in `mod_pandavideo` for proper functionality.**

With this plugin, it's very easy to select a video and insert it into any Moodle activity.
